# AR Game through Open CV

Our project is a game that combines CV and AR into the gameplay. The human player would be able to add obstacles to the game environment by placing them in front of a separate game display screen, OpenCV would detect the obstacles, and these obstacles would be generated through pygame as a component that other features in the game could interact with. This idea is based off of a project we were impressed by at MakeHarvard (https://devpost.com/software/puppet-io).

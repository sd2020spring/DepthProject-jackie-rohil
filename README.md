# What is this?

Our project is a game that combines CV and AR into the gameplay. The human player would be able to add obstacles to the game environment by placing them in front of a separate game display screen, OpenCV would detect the obstacles, and these obstacles would be generated through pygame as a component that other features in the game could interact with. This idea is based off of [Puppet.io](https://devpost.com/software/puppet-io), a project we were impressed by at MakeHarvard 2020.

# Instructions
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

To get started, clone this respository onto your device.

## Prerequisites
To be able to run this game, you must have OpenCV installed. 
- For Ubuntu, use the command `$ pip install opencv-python` or click [here](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d2/de6/tutorial_py_setup_in_ubuntu.html) for instructions
- For Windows, click [here](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html) for instructions

## How to Run Our Game
**TODO**: List descriptions of each file, what they do, and what order to run them in. 



# The Game: Development and Results

## Implementation
**TODO**: Add details about the program architecture. Also add program snippets and descriptions of what they do (image filtration, contour capture).

Here is a flow diagram or our setup that gives an overview of the different steps that the program must take in order to run the game.

## See It in Action!
**TODO**: Embed Youtube video of the game being played.



# Our Story and Context

## Narrative
**TODO**: Add details about the full development process and the reasons behind decisions we made.

## Ethical Considerations
**TODO**: There may be more considerations that we missed, so we should take some time to think about these and add to this section.
Even in something as seemingly simple as a ball drop game, there can be unintended, negative consequences that arise when the game is deployed in real-world scenarios. Therefore, as developers, we have a responsibility to think very intentionally about where things can go wrong, and we must do our best to protect against these potential issues. We must also have humility and be willing to accept that sometimes, even with our best efforts, things can still go wrong. When issues are exposed unexpectedly after deployment, we must have processes in place that allow for rapid mitigation.
There are a few major areas of concern that we were able to identify for this project.
